The Problem

Using ruby, please code a class that represents a standard deck of playing cards.

A "standard" deck of playing cards consists of a stack of 52 Cards in each of the 4 suits of Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs. Each suit contains 13 cards, in order of rank: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

Note that the deck should consider "Ace" as the highest Rank of card.

The deck should be usable for any standard card game that uses a single deck of cards, including the following capabilities:

deal a card from the top of the deck
return a card to the bottom of the deck
compare cards by rank

Include a script of tests that demonstrate the functioning of the class.
You may use additional classes as appropriate, but you should not use the Rails framework or any other third-party gems or plug-ins.‚Äù
